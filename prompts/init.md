Create a fully dockerized with a FastApi based python backend.

The Api should be capable of accepting a post request that will contain an image and some json containing a user_id and other fields. The API will call a ChatGPT endpoint and do some other processing and return json.

Please document in a comment the curl command that can be used to test the api

Additionally please update the Makfile with rules to start/stop/restart the backend service.
